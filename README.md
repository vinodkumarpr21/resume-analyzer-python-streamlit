<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

The Resume Analyzer App is a lightweight web application built with Python and Streamlit. It
enables users to upload a PDF resume, analyze its content, extract relevant skills and experience,
and match the resume with a given job description (JD). This helps recruiters and candidates
assess how well a resume aligns with a job role.

Manual resume screening is slow, inefficient, and often biased. This project aims to:
- Automatically extracts text from resumes (PDF format).
- Identifies and lists relevant skills from the resume.
- Estimates candidateâ€™s years of experience.
- Compares resume skills with job description keywords.
- Calculates and displays a match score to help in shortlisting.
- Saves recruiters time and improves hiring efficiency.
